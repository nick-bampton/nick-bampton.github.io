I study small target detection and tracking with a focus on theoretcial analysis. I am particularly interested in this field of study as it is both challenging yet well suited for simplistic models and assumptions. My research currently spans three notable directions

- A unified theory of dynamic programming and the inverse relationship between certainty in existence and certainty in location
- Topological background modeling and filtering, operators that preserve the persistent homology and contour tree
- Low Rank Tensor decomposition and filtering, blind demixing of time shifted images and the region of convergence in gradient descent
